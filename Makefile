# ---------- DOCKER BUILD ----------
#Make sure you're building images before tagging/pushing
#make sure app images are rebuilt when you change Dockerfiles or deps:
#Docker builds images with tags:
#	myapp:latest
#	mylearning:latest
docker-build:
	docker compose build #build image with dev dependency.

# ---------- DOCKER DB ----------
docker-db:
	docker compose up -d db

# ---------- DOCKER TEST ----------
#Parallel Docker Tests (Advanced)
#Note:
#      1. docker compose run SERVICE COMMAND starts a one-time container
#      for a specific service and runs the command you give it.
#      For example, docker compose run web bash starts the web service and opens a shell in it.
#      It reads settings from compose.yml, so you reuse the service config instead of rewriting ports, env vars, and volumes manually.
#      The command you pass overrides the service’s default command.
#      2. docker compose up --build → forces a build step first, then starts containers, ensuring you’re running with the latest code/Dockerfile changes.
#         it reads docker-compose.yml file
#      3. --remove-orphans
#				remove any container created earlier those are orphan now
#      4. --abort-on-container-exit
#				--abort-on-container-exit = foreground mode (watch containers). if any container (e.g. pytest inside myapp) exits, Compose stops the whole stack.
#				Note: - As soon as any container in the stack exits (for any reason), Docker Compose stops all other containers and the up command returns.
#                     - If mylearning’s container exits quickly (e.g. runs tests then exits, or crashes), myapp (uvicorn) is stopped too, and the up command ends.
#	   5. docker compose run --rm myapp poetry run pytest
#				overrides CMD with poetry run pytest and ignores the Dockerfile CMD.
#	   6. docker compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit
#               Starts services as defined in docker-compose.yml. whatever command the service has will run.
#               If they have no command: in docker-compose.yml,	then it will run CMD [] command from corresponding Dockefile
#      7. docker compose run --rm myapp poetry run pytest
#				Here, myapp is service name from docker-compose.yml file instead of image name.
#	   8. If you want machine-readable reports for CI for code coverage, add XML:coverage.xml
#				- This writes coverage.xml inside the container;
#	    		- Add a threshold in your pytest command using --cov-fail-under.
#					If coverage drops below the threshold, pytest exits non‑zero and CI fails.
#				- Your code lives at mylearning/src/exercises/..., and the Python package name is exercises
#				- --cov must point to the importable package/module,
#				- --cov-report=term-missing, which prints a table into the CI log.
